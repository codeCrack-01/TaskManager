# TaskManager
A simple Task Manager.

This is a simple Command-Line-Interface Task Manage App which demonstrates basic use-case of sqlite3 databases.
It uses SQLAlchemy module in Python to link to the database and execute the commands. 
I have also made an .exe version using 'pyinstaller' package. Have fun using it ðŸ™‚
